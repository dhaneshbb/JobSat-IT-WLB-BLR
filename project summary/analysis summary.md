## **3. Literature Review**  
### **Key Themes**  
- **Job Satisfaction**: Influenced by compensation, recognition, and growth opportunities (Herzberg’s Two-Factor Theory).  
- **Work-Life Balance**: Boundary Theory highlights the struggle to separate work and personal life, exacerbated by remote work.  
- **Gender Dynamics**: Prior studies indicate women often face higher work-life conflict due to caregiving responsibilities.  

### **Research Gaps**  
Limited focus on Bangalore’s unique IT ecosystem and gender-specific stressors in hybrid work models.

## **4. Methodology**  
### **Data Collection**  
- **Sample**: 205 IT professionals (111 male, 94 female) via stratified random sampling.  
- **Tools**: Structured Google Forms questionnaire with Likert-scale and categorical questions.  

### **Statistical Techniques**  
- **Chi-Squared Tests**: Evaluated associations between gender and variables (e.g., work experience, marital status).  
- **Cramer’s V and Fisher’s Exact Test**: Applied for small-sample contingency tables.  
- **Mosaic/Fourfold Plots**: Visualized categorical relationships (e.g., gender vs. stress management).  
- **Odds Ratios**: Analyzed associations like gender and work-related illness.  

### **Software**  
- **R Programming**: For hypothesis testing and visualization (packages: `vcd`, `epitools`).  
- **MS Excel**: Data cleaning and preliminary analysis.

## **5. Data Analysis and Findings**  
### **5.1 Demographics**  
- **Work Experience**:  
  - 49.27% had 1–3 years of experience.  
  - No gender association (χ²=3.59, p=0.309).  
  - **Visual**: Mosaic plot (Fig. 1) showed balanced distribution across experience brackets.  

- **Marital Status**:  
  - 72.68% unmarried; no gender disparity (χ²≈0, p=1).  

### **5.2 Remote Work Dynamics**  
- **Productivity**:  
  - 56.59% reported improved productivity with remote work.  
  - No gender difference (χ²=0.58, p=0.447).  
  - **Visual**: Fourfold plot (Fig. 2) illustrated similar responses across genders.  

- **Hours Worked Remotely**:  
  - 55.61% worked <10 hours/week remotely.  
  - **Insight**: Flexible hours preferred but not universally adopted.  

### **5.3 Health and Well-being**  
- **Burnout**:  
  - 23.41% experienced work-related illness.  
  - **Odds Ratio**: Females had 1.52x higher odds (OR=1.52, 95% CI: 0.78–2.94), though not statistically significant.  

- **Stress Management**:  
  - Top strategies: Hobbies (39.51%), meditation (33.66%).  
  - No gender preference (χ²=0.33, p=0.847).  

### **5.4 Job Satisfaction**  
- **Key Drivers**:  
  - **Dissatisfaction**: Insufficient compensation (17.07%), limited skill development (17.07%).  
  - **Satisfaction**: 54.15% rated job satisfaction ≥7/10.  
  - **Gender**: Marginal association (χ²=15.37, p=0.081).  

### **5.5 Work-Life Balance**  
- **Social Engagements**:  
  - 46.34% "sometimes" declined due to work.

## **6. Discussion**  
### **Key Insights**  
1. **Gender Neutrality**: Most variables showed no gender disparity, challenging stereotypes about work-life conflict.  
2. **Remote Work Paradox**: While boosting productivity, it blurred work-life boundaries, necessitating structured policies.  
3. **Compensation vs. Skill Growth**: Dissatisfaction stemmed equally from pay and development opportunities.  

### **Theoretical Alignment**  
- Herzberg’s Hygiene Factors: Compensation (hygiene) and growth (motivator) both critical.  
- Boundary Theory: Remote work eroded boundaries, increasing stress despite productivity gains.
